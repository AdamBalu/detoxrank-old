    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_1">In this chapter, you will learn basics about</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_1_part_2">. So what exactly is it?\n\nDopamine is a</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_1_part_3">in the dopaminergic pathway in the brain.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_1_part_4">Wait, that doesn\'t say much to
        someone who never studied itâ€¦ let\'s delve deeper into what it means.\n
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2">To find out what dopamine is, we need to first get a basic understanding of how the brain works.\n</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2_part_2">
        You probably already know that in the human brain,
        there are plenty of signals being constantly sent between individual cells. </string>

    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2_part_3">These signals are sent by a&#160;special, electrically excitable cell called</string>

    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_3_part_1">is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron. Basically, it functions as a messenger who delivers
        the information from point A to point B through the neurotic pathways called</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_3_part_2">On the picture you can see a synapse. Neurotransmitters travel through these synapses from a sending neuron to a
        receiving neuron and they are caught on the other end by the receptors.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_1">You might be wondering, what do you get from all this? Well, now comes the important part.\n\nAs we already mentioned,
    dopamine is one of those neurotransmitters. And what it does is that by traveling back and forth, it</string>

    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_2">- good ones or bad ones, it doesn\'t care.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_3">It\'s also responsible for the feeling of </string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_4">something (which is not the same as</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_5">, there is an important distinction to be made right here!)\n\nFor
    example, you are really excited to binge-watch an entire series, but how enjoyable is it after eight hours of watching compared
    to the first hour?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4_part_6">The problem is that after those eight hours, you don\'t really feel motivated towards anything - especially anything productive, but it\'s usually really hard to stop watching!</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_5_part_1">That concludes this chapter! To summarize, you learned some new terms (most
        of them will be further discussed later): </string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_5_part_2">Well done! Next up, we will discuss liking versus wanting.</string>
    <string name="chapter_2_text_1_part_1">
        In the last chapter, we made an important statement. It stated that liking is not the same as wanting.
        Physically, brain handles these two in different parts. Liking is handled in the hedonic circuit, which
        has it\'s own neurotransmitters with orbitofrontal cortex as the main handler, as you can see on the picture.

        Wanting is the main attribute of dopaminergic circuit, also called reward circuitry, with it\'s main calculations
        being processed by the nucleus accumbens.
