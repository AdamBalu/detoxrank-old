    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_1">In this chapter, you will learn basics about</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_2">. So what exactly is it?\n\nDopamine is a</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_3">in the dopaminergic pathway in the brain.</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_4">
        Wait, that doesn\'t say much to
        someone who never studied itâ€¦ let\'s delve deeper into what it means.\n
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_1">
        To find out what dopamine is, we need to first get a basic understanding of how the brain works.\n
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_2">
        You probably already know that in the human brain,
        there are plenty of signals being constantly sent between individual cells. </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_3">
        These signals are sent by a&#160;special, electrically excitable cell called
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_3_pt_1">
        is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron. Basically, it functions as a messenger who delivers
        the information from point A to point B through the neurotic pathways called
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_3_pt_2">On the picture you can see a synapse. Neurotransmitters travel through these synapses from a sending neuron to a
        receiving neuron and they are caught on the other end by the receptors.</string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_1">
        You might be wondering, what do you get from all this? Well, now comes the important part.\n\nAs we already mentioned, dopamine
        is one of those neurotransmitters. And what it does is that by traveling back and forth, it
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_2">- good ones or bad ones, it doesn\'t care.</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_3">It\'s also responsible for the feeling of </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_4">something (which is not the same as</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_5">
        , there is an important distinction to be made right here!)\n\nFor
    example, you are really excited to binge-watch an entire series, but how enjoyable is it after eight hours of watching compared
    to the first hour?
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_6">
        The problem is that after those eight hours, you don\'t really feel motivated towards
        anything&#160;-&#160;especially anything productive, but it\'s usually really hard to stop watching!

        and each of them is responsible for a particular function.

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_1_pt_3">
        Taking them apart and looking specifically at the ones that are involved in dopaminergic
        activities helps significantly. It leads to a better understanding and hopefully provides you with more motivation.

        When we talk about dopamine, the main circuit, which this neurotransmitter operates in, is called

        is the main process performed by this circuit when we engage in different activities.\n\nLet\'s take a look at an example.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_3_pt_1">
        Let\'s consider drugs.

        Addictive substances are incredibly strong. They
        are also called</string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_3_pt_3">
        By taking a drug, which usually releases exceptionally high amounts of dopamine, you directly activate
        this process and therefore substantially reinforce the behavior.\n\nNote: Even an anticipation of the drug releases dopamine!

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_1">
        This process is also called
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_2">
        You learn to take the drug. We can see people having very low interest in activities which are not as rewarding
        (in terms of dopamine release) when they are used to high dopamine releases&#160;-&#160;they most likely won\'t prefer a walk outside in this state.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_3">
         Also, the next time they feel even more devastating desire to take the drug again.\n\nWith no
        access to the desired drug, there are often severe motivational issues.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_4">In
        the same way, just a little bit weaker, reinforcement occurs with other dopaminergic activities such as
        browsing social media or watching too many videos and movies.</string>
