    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_1_part_4">Wait, that doesn\'t say much to
        someone who never studied itâ€¦ let\'s delve deeper into what it means.\n
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2">To find out what dopamine is, we need to first get a basic understanding of how the brain works.\n</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2_part_2">
        You probably already know that in the human brain,
        there are plenty of signals being constantly sent between individual cells. </string>

    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_2_part_3">These signals are sent by a&#160;special, electrically excitable cell called</string>

    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_4">A neurotransmitter is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron. Basically, it functions as a messenger who delivers
        the information from point A to point B through the neurotic pathways called synapses.\n</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_5">On the picture you can see a synapse, which you can imagine as a sender or receiver
        and yellow tiny "dots" called neurotransmitters which travel across
    the different pathways created by these synapses.\n</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_dopamine_theory_text_6">You might be wondering, what do you get from all this? Well, now comes the important part.\n\nAs we already mentioned,
    dopamine is one of those neurotransmitters. And what it does is that by traveling back and forth, it reinforces your behaviors - good ones or bad ones, it doesn\'t care.\n\nIt\'s
        also responsible for the feeling of wanting something (which is not the same as liking, there is an important distinction to be made right here!)</string>
