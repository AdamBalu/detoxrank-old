    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_1">In this chapter, you will learn basics about</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_2">. So what exactly is it?\n\nDopamine is a</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_3">in the dopaminergic pathway in the brain.</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_1_pt_4">
        Wait, that doesn\'t say much to
        someone who never studied itâ€¦ let\'s delve deeper into what it means.\n
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_1">
        To find out what dopamine is, we need to first get a basic understanding of how the brain works.\n
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_2">
        You probably already know that in the human brain,
        there are plenty of signals being constantly sent between individual cells. </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_2_pt_3">
        These signals are sent by a&#160;special, electrically excitable cell called
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_3_pt_1">
        is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron. Basically, it functions as a messenger who delivers
        the information from point A to point B through the neurotic pathways called
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_3_pt_2">In the picture you can see a synapse. Neurotransmitters travel through these synapses from a sending neuron to a
        receiving neuron and they are caught on the other end by the receptors.</string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_1">
        You might be wondering, what do you get from all this? Well, now comes the important part.\n\nAs we already mentioned, dopamine
        is one of those neurotransmitters. And what it does is that by traveling back and forth, it
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_2">- good ones or bad ones, it doesn\'t care.</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_3">It\'s also responsible for the feeling of </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_4">something (which is not the same as</string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_5">
        , there is an important distinction to be made right here!)\n\nFor
    example, you are really excited to binge-watch an entire series, but how enjoyable is it after eight hours of watching compared
    to the first hour?
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_4_pt_6">
        The problem is that after those eight hours, you don\'t really feel motivated towards
        anything&#160;-&#160;especially anything productive, but it\'s usually really hard to stop watching!
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_dopamine_screen_5_pt_1">
        That concludes this chapter! To summarize, you learned some new terms (most
        of them will be further discussed later):

        Brain has many different parts and</string>

        and each of them is responsible for a particular function.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_1_pt_3">
        Taking them apart and looking specifically at the ones that are involved in dopaminergic
        activities helps significantly. It leads to a better understanding and hopefully provides you with more motivation.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_2_pt_1">
        When we talk about dopamine, the main circuit, which this neurotransmitter operates in, is called

        is the main process performed by this circuit when we engage in different activities.\n\nLet\'s take a look at an example.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_3_pt_1">
        Let\'s consider drugs.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_3_pt_2">
        Addictive substances are incredibly strong. They
        are also called</string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_3_pt_3">
        By taking a drug, which usually releases exceptionally high amounts of dopamine, you directly activate
        this process and therefore substantially reinforce the behavior.\n\nNote: Even an anticipation of the drug releases dopamine!
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_1">
        This process is also called
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_2">
        You learn to take the drug. We can see people having very low interest in activities which are not as rewarding
        (in terms of dopamine release) when they are used to high dopamine releases&#160;-&#160;they most likely won\'t prefer a walk outside in this state.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_3">
         Also, the next time they feel even more devastating desire to take the drug again.\n\nWith no
        access to the desired drug, there are often severe motivational issues.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_4_pt_4">In
        the same way, just a little bit weaker, reinforcement occurs with other dopaminergic activities such as
        browsing social media or watching too many videos and movies.</string>

    <string name="chapter_reinforcement_screen_5_pt_1">Good job! In the next chapter, you will learn about developing tolerance.</string>


    <!-- ******************************************** -->

    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_1_pt_1">
        The brain constantly receives signals. If it receives a signal in a high frequency, it
        adapts to that signal&#160;-&#160;it develops a
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_1_pt_2">
        Let\'s look at an example.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_1">
        Imagine a drug addict.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_2">
         He first stumbles upon a drug. He only takes a very small dose.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_3">
        However, even this amount is enough for him to feel a big hit.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_4">
        After he starts taking the drug again and again, the brain adapts to the intake of that
        substance. It
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_5">
        of the drug, and the guy doesn\'t feel as big of a hit as
        before.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_2_pt_6">
        He therefore starts consuming larger and larger doses, leading to a
        very brutal and unforgiving spiral of addiction.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_3_pt_1">The same applies for dopamine "hits". Regular
        and high releases of dopamine lead to your brain
        developing a
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_3_pt_2">
        towards them.\n\nThen, you usually feel the need to increase the doses. We
        can see these in action with social media addictions.
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_3_pt_3">
        People often spend hours and hours on social media in the need of dopamine.\n\nAfter
        several hours, they usually feel really bad
        about themselves (they are often not even enjoying it!). However, they find it
        really hard to stop.
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_tolerance_screen_4_pt_1">
        \nAwesome!\n\nYou learned about tolerance.\n\nNow, let\'s look at the hedonic circuit in the next chapter.

        Do you remember when we stated that people don\'t enjoy spending hours on social media?\n\nWell,
        this is where we can see a difference between the reward circuitry

    <string name="chapter_hedonic_circuit_screen_2_pt_1">
        Imagine yourself in a situation&#160;-&#160;your family is organizing a skiing/hiking trip in the mountains.

        more?
    </string>

    <string name="chapter_hedonic_circuit_screen_3_pt_1">
        Most of you would probably choose the internet.\n\nBut if you remember the last time you
        went on a similar trip with your family, you probably really enjoyed it
    </string>
    <string name="chapter_hedonic_circuit_screen_3_pt_2">
        Here you can see how wanting something differs from liking something,
        and how your damaged reward circuitry can affect your short-term decisions, even

        This one is probably the most important, because
        lately it has been on a steady rise and it\'s severely affecting our brain in mostly negative ways.\n\nThink

        There has also been a heavy rise in porn addiction.\n\nIf you are someone who struggles with that (or any other urge as a matter of fact), try to learn how to control your urges.
